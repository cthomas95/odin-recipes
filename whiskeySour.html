    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The key to an excellent whiskey sour? Getting the balance just right. This whiskey sour recipe has all the right 
        proportions of bright, bracing lemon juice; warming, floral bourbon; and sweet simple syrup to deliver a refreshing
        cocktail that’s neither too cloying nor too biting. Using freshly squeezed juice is essential—the stuff that comes 
        out of fruit-shaped squeeze bottles doesn’t even compare. If you don't have any lemon on hand, 
        you can swap it out for lime (or a mixture of the two). Serve on the rocks with an orange wheel and a 
        Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear (optional but recommended!), and enjoy. Cheers!
